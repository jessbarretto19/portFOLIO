This project was completed in collaboration with 2 teammates. I was responsible, first, for creating and testing the fetchCurrentTemperature.js file.
Then, my teammates, after completing their respective files, and I collaborated on the universityWeather.js file.

This project shows my ability to work with asynchronous programming and APIs, as well as collaborating effectively with coworkers.
